[IDE website](http://visualstudio.com/)

# Reason for choosing those tools
## Why choose Java
OOP, classes, interfaces, inheritance, exception handling, collections
## Why choose Spring Boot
- Make it easier to get started with Spring development
- Minimize the amount of manual configuration
- Perform auto-configuration based on props files and JAR classpath
- Help to resolve dependency conflicts (Maven or Gradle)
- Provide an embedded HTTP server so you can get started quickly
- Tomcat, Jetty, Undertow, …
## Why choose Angular
Angular is a framework that supports:
- **Component-based** framework

- Clean separation of template coding and application logic (MVVM framework)

- Built-in support for **data-binding** and **dependency injection**

- Supports responsive web design and modern frameworks

- Bootstrap, Google Material Design (Angular Material) and others ...
## Why choose TypeScript?
For React Development, we can develop using various languages

• JavaScript: extremely popular programming language

• ECMAScript: standardized version of JavaScript (ES6, ES9, ...)

• [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): adds optional types to JavaScript

• Other languages such as Dart, etc ...

TypeScript is the **most popular language for React development**
